## About KeepFit
KeepFit is an Android application created for CSCI 310 at USC in Spring 2021. The application allows users to view exercise video recordings and live streamed workouts. Along with these basic functionalities, users can search using keywords for videos and/or other user profiles. They can also see a history of the videos they have uploaded, videos they have liked, and an estimate of the calories they have burned while performing various exercises. Additionally, users will be able to view live streams of the users they follow to workout alongside them.

The strategic objectives of this application are to introduce new users to effective exercises tailored to their interests to support their physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since many people are unable to go to the gym, KeepFit will offer them virtual alternatives to in-person exercise centers.  Existing users can also use the application to maintain their physical fitness and join users that they follow in live streamed workouts. Through the app, they will be able to share their exercise progress and experiments with others on the app to fulfill the social aspect of working out that is missed during the pandemic.
